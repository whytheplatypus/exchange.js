#exchange.js

A local exchange server that lets peers connect to eachother. This means that once peers are connected by some n degree
of separation they can connect directly without needing a server.

A simple example can be found in test/test.html

I'll have more examples and a better description of how to work with exchange.js up eventually, but for now the
example in test.html should get you started. Any help and/or bug reports would be lovely!
